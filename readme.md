<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Projects


Course was taken on my 4th semester of Automation and Robotics studies. It consisted of lecture and laboratories that involved problem solving using:
* sorting algoriths 
* graphs 
* trees
* ADT structures 

The main objectives of the course:
* Acquiring knowledge in the analysis of combinatorial problems (mainly under k
trump them with lo-
Computational complexity).
* Acquiring knowledge and skills
ethics in the use of
e with selected algorithms, ie construction and selection of an appropriate type of algorithm for a given problem.
* Acquisition of skills
the ethics of selecting appropriate data structures for specific types of algorithms.
* Acquiring knowledge and skills
ethics in the field of analysis of algorithms under
an asset to their effectiveness.
* Acquiring knowledge and skills
ethics in the use of artificial intelligence methods in solutions
solving combinatorial problems.
* Acquisition of skills
ethics of searching for information in scientific literature and using instrument documentation
edi programming.



### Built With
As the objective of the course was to learn the patterns behind commonly used I used low-level programming that allows me to manually take care of all the operations. It was supported with Qt that allowed me to create window type application for better visual experience.
* [C++](https://getbootstrap.com)
* [Qt](https://jquery.com)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Enter your API in `config.js`
   ```JS
   const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
   ```
