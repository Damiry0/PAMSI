<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Projects


Course was taken on my 4th semester of Automation and Robotics studies. It consisted of lecture and laboratories that involved problem solving using:
* Sorting algoriths 
* Graphs 
* Trees
* ADT structures 
* Artificial Inteligence

### The main objectives of the course:
* Acquiring knowledge in the analysis of combinatorial problems (mainly under k
trump them with lo-
Computational complexity).
* Acquiring knowledge and skills
ethics in the use of
e with selected algorithms, ie construction and selection of an appropriate type of algorithm for a given problem.
* Acquisition of skills
the ethics of selecting appropriate data structures for specific types of algorithms.
* Acquiring knowledge and skills
ethics in the field of analysis of algorithms under
an asset to their effectiveness.
* Acquiring knowledge and skills
ethics in the use of artificial intelligence methods in solutions
solving combinatorial problems.
* Acquisition of skills
ethics of searching for information in scientific literature and using instrument documentation
edi programming.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Project 1

First project involved creating ADT structure that can handle the job of non sequecential packet trasfer through Internet. I decided to use priority queue based on list. The main advantages of this implementation were:
* Dynamical data alocation
* Storing data in format [key,value]
* Easiness of implementation
* O(n) time complexity for adding, deleting and displaying

## Project 2

Second project involved comparison of selected sorting algorithms on large database which was a forked imdb movie rating list. I decided to compare 4 diffrent algorithms:
* MergeSort
* QuickSort
* IntroSort
* BucketSort

Results of research you can see down below:

## Project 3

The last project involved creating a simple game to which we had to implement a artificial inteligence. I decided to create a tic tac toe game with MinMax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta prunings. Program is available [HERE](https://github.com/Damiry0/TicTacToe).

### Built With
As the objective of the course was to learn the patterns behind commonly used I used low-level programming that allows me to manually take care of all the operations. It was supported with Qt that allowed me to create window type application for better visual experience.

* [Qt](www.qt.io)
